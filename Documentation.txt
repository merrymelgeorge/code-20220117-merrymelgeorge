The python code helps to find the BMI using the data which contains the weight in Kg and Height in cm. 
The following steps are implemented in the code:
1. The data is loaded from the json file using the json package
2. The loaded data is used to create a pandas dataframe
3. BMI is calculated using the formula - weight in kgs/((height in cm)/100)*(((height in cm)/100)). 
   This is implemented in the python code as a lambda function
4. Using the provided the BMI to BMI catgeory mapping, each of the calculated BMI's are mapped to the corresponding category.
   The BMI Category mapping is implemented using a lambda function with if else conditions
5. Using the provided the BMI to Health Risk catgeory mapping, each of the calculated BMI's are mapped to the corresponding category.
   The Health Risk catgeory mapping is also implemented using a lambda function with if else conditions
6. The newly calculated attributes are appended to the existing dataframe
7. The total number of overweight people are found
